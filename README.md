iPhone App in Swift - How many days old are you?

Source code for the app that was created during the iPhone app presentation at [AppRochester](http://approchester.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/sept-2nd-learn-swift-from-paul-solt/)

The app calculates how old you are using user input with UITextField objects, output with UILabel, and actions with the UIButton.

The code uses NSDateComponents, NSDate, NSCalendar, and String objects in Swift. The API usage is almost the same, except for a few parameters that need to be different because of Swift optionals.
